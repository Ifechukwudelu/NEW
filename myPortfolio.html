           <p id="p1">I'm Ifechukwudelu. A designer,
           <br> maker and problem solver.</p>
           <br>

           <p>The cusp of art and technology has always fascinated me and I've never <br>
           been afraid to just jump in and give it a go, whether it's Paint, Powerpoint<br>
           Sketch or CSS. I’ve been designing with computers since the day I first <br>
           opened Microsoft Paint.<br><br>

           Fast forward to 2024 and I’ve done a lot, from  Ms Word and Powerpoint <br>
           to Web Design, HTML/CSS Development. Everything I have done, small or <br>
           big, has been a vital stepping stone for where I am today.
           <br>
           <br>


           What excites me most about being a WEbsite Designer is being able to 
           <br>design and create things that have purpose and solve real problems. It goes 
           <br>beyond designing buttons and websites and involves having a passion for 
           <br>designing experiences and solutions that help people, Leaning into customer
           <br> insight and understanding their needs, finding the right problems to solve, 
           <br>delivering solutions as quickly as possible, learning from those and then 
           <br>iterating and improving that value over time is the key to great web design.
           <br>
           <br>

           This is one of my favourite quotes (by Peter Drucker):
           <br>
           <br>


           <span id="quote">“There is nothing so useless as 
            <br>doing efficiently that which 
            <br>should not be done at all.”</span>
           <br>
           <br>
           
           This resonates so deeply with me because I have no desire to make pretty 
           <br>things just for the sake of it. Some people love that! But it's not for me.I only 
           <br>want to make, design or build ideas and products that are real, that matter 
           <br>and have an impact in the world.

           <p>Most of what is in this portfolio is team work, it's very rare these days to 
           <br>make anything great all on your own. I have only included work that I had a 
           <br>large contribution to, but whether it's design, ideas, process, mentorship, 
           <br>advice or creative direction, the following people have influenced my growth 
           <br>and career path in a massive way: Akorede Abaoba, Oscar , Ani Godfery, 
           <br>Jideofor Kingsley, Abani Chikezie, Mr Robert Udeneani. THANK YOU.
